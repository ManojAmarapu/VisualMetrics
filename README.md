🧠 System Design Overview

1️⃣ Input Layer

User selects symptoms via UI

Inputs passed to preprocessing pipeline


2️⃣ Processing Layer

Symptoms vectorized

ML classifier predicts probable disease


3️⃣ Intelligence Layer

Treatment engine generates structured guidance

AI chat layer responds contextually


4️⃣ Visualization Layer

Charts display prediction trends

Metrics summarize outcomes


🛡️ Safety Considerations

HealthAI is designed as:

A learning & research tool

A decision-support system

Not a replacement for medical professionals

All recommendations are advisory and educational.


📈 Performance & Stability

Lightweight model loading

Efficient symptom encoding

Streamlit rerun optimization

Clean state management across sessions


🔍 Edge Case Handling

Empty symptom validation

Model confidence threshold checks

Safe default outputs

Error handling for invalid input


📌 Future Improvements

Deep learning-based disease model

Medical API integration

User authentication system

Patient history tracking

Real-time doctor consultation interface

Multi-language support
